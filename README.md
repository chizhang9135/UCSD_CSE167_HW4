## Some Idea about the onject I created
There are several objects in the scene. 
It is electrolysis of water.  
2H2O -> 2H2 + O2  
There are two water molecules, two hydrogen molecules and one oxygen molecule.


## Better rendering using blender are in the `Blender Renders` folder. Including pngs and blend files.
